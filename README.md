A Metalsmith plugin to find related files within collections.

Files are "related" if they share important terms in their contents.

For each file in a collection, [Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is used to:

- Find the top `natural.maxTerms` important terms in the file's contents
- Find how much weight those terms have in every other file in the collection
- Filter matches that have at least `natural.minTfIdf` weight
- Sort by descending weight (most "related" first)
- Limit to `maxRelated` number of matches

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save metalsmith-collections-related
```

## JavaScript Usage

Collections need to be processed before related files can be found:

```javascript
const Metalsmith  = require('metalsmith');
const collections = require('metalsmith-collections');
const related     = require('metalsmith-collections-related');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
    .use(collections({
        // options here
    }))
    .use(related({
        // options here
    }))
    .build((err) => {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }
    });
```

## File metadata

This plugin adds a metadata field named `related` to each file in the format:

```json5
{
  "contents": "...",
  "path": "...",
  "related": {
    "[collection name]": [
      { "contents": "...", "path": "..." },
      { "contents": "...", "path": "..." }
      // up to the `maxRelated` number of files
    ],
    "[another collection name]": [
      { "contents": "...", "path": "..." },
      { "contents": "...", "path": "..." }
      // up to the `maxRelated` number of files
    ]
    // up to as many collections as the file is in
  }
}
```

which can be used with templating engines, such as with [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars):

```handlebars
{{#each related}}
    <a href="{{ path }}">{{ path }}</a>
{{/each}}
```
